### Todo

- [ ] PPT: Different Dataset  
- [ ] Import pre-trained model  

### In Progress

- [ ] Poor performance of Blocked dataset  

### Done âœ“

- [x] Change folder names  
- [x] Bug of blocked set(out_bound y_max): https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations/issues/459  


#### Keypoint Scenarios

This repository supports the detection of 2 keypoints scenarios. You can use the provided labeller to label your images accordingly.

#### Pretrained Weights

If you don't want to train the model from scratch, you can use the pretrained weights provided in this repository for a simple demo.
